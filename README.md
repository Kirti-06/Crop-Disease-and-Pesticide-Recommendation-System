# Crop Disease Detection and Pesticide Recommendation System 
A Crop Disease and Pesticide Recommendation System is a decision-support tool that assists farmers in identifying crop diseases and making recommendations for the most effective pesticides. It analyzes data on crop health, environmental conditions, and insect resistance to optimize pesticide application, increase productivity, and enhance sustainable agriculture while minimizing chemical effect on the environment.!

The methodology for "Crop Disease and Pest Detection Using CNN" is a multi-step process. Firstly, a comprehensive dataset of images containing healthy crops and crops affected by diseases and pests is collected. 

These images are then preprocessed to enhance their quality and remove any noise. Next, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is constructed and trained using the preprocessed images. 

The model learns to recognize patterns and features that distinguish healthy crops from diseased ones. 

Finally, the trained CNN model is utilized to classify and detect crop diseases and pests accurately. This approach can greatly assist farmers in early identification and effective management of crop health.!
